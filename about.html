                    <h2>Josh Shackleton</h2>
                    <h3>Goalkeeper Coach</h3>
                    <p>Josh is the goalkeeper coach for The Academy at Wānaka FC. Josh also plays in the Wānaka FC First Team as starting goalkeeper.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Originally from Auckland, Josh played for his boyhood club Papakura City FC from First Kicks at 5 years old, all the way through to the First Team. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Josh has gained great experience as a goalkeeper coach in an academy environment over the last couple of years, and he's highly regarded by the local youth academy players. Being a senior player, he also adds value as a leader and mentor for our young academy players as they make the transition into the First Team environment. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Not having access to goalkeeper-specific training as a young goalkeeper himself, Josh loves having the opportunity to offer this to aspiring goalkeepers now. He enjoys seeing players challenge themselves to get better, take on advice from training and put it into play. </p>
